## My Journey

I’ve always believed in the art and process of figuring things out—whether in my career as a software engineer or in my personal life. Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate that the journey holds just as much value as the destination. I’ll admit, I’ve struggled at times with not excelling at something right away. Embracing the discomfort of learning is a work in progress for me, but it’s a challenge I tackle every day.

I began my career as a Speech-Language Pathologist, working with adults in an acute hospital setting. I loved helping patients achieve their goals and diving into the complexities of differential diagnoses. However, the rigidity of the healthcare system sometimes felt limiting, and the emotional toll of working with acute illness began to weigh on me.

Since then, I’ve been on a journey to find the intersection between helping people achieve their goals and solving problems with tangible results. My growth in technical skills, servant leadership, and confidence has been shaped by countless challenges, failures, and small wins that continue to teach me something new.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my space to share insights and experiences about leadership, technology, and personal growth. My hope is to inspire others who are also “figuring it out.” You’ll find reflections on lessons I’ve learned in my career, musings on becoming a better leader, and the strategies I use to stay grounded amidst life’s chaos. Beyond work, I share personal essays—because life isn’t just what happens Monday through Friday—and series that explore books I’m reading, as well as the occasional hot take.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m most likely baking, reading, or spending time with my family. Whether it’s experimenting with a new bread recipe, getting lost in a good book, or making memories with loved ones, these activities keep me balanced and fueled for the journey of figuring it all out.
